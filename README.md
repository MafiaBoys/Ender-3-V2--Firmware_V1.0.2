## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Install PlatformIO IDE
The first time you open the Marlin project in VSCode it will recommend you install the Auto Build Marlin extension, which will also install PlatformIO IDE. Simply answer “Yes” to install the extensions, or follow the instructions below.

## Open Marlin in VSCode / PlatformIO
Unzip the downloaded archive to your preferred location. (Although modern systems can handle very long paths, it may still help with the build process if the filepath is short without any special characters.)

You can open Marlin in Visual Studio Code in one of several ways:

    1- Drag your downloaded Marlin Firmware folder onto the Visual Studio Code application icon.
    2- Use the Open… command in the VSCode File menu.
    3- Open the PIO Home tab and click the “Open Project” button.
